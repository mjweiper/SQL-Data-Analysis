![erd](ERD.PNG)

## Data Engineering

Created a Entity Relationship Diagram to plan out framework to combine 6 CSV files with employee information.Exported ERD to pgAdmin. Using PgAdmin, I was able to use this framework and create table schemas for a employee database. In doing this I have created primary and foreign keys to align data.
